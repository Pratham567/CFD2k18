Arduino + PHP project

Used to control an Arduino micro controller through a PHP Interface.

This project is very old and has not been maintained for a long time, it might not even work from the start, so a little fiddling with the code might be necessary.

This code was uploaded here because of numerous request from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxWR0Iak2ZI
